  A PhilPapers survey conducted by David Bourget and David Chalmers asked over 1700 philosophers around the world to provide their thoughts on a variety of philosophical problems. All participants published papers in English. The participants were asked to answer at least 50 questions, but many of them answered all 100 questions. This survey follows up on a survey conducted in 2009 that asked over 900 philosophers about their opinions on 30 questions, resulting in the published paper 'What Do Philosophers Believe' (2014). In early 2023, Dr. Aaron Nielson and Josh Brekel reached out to Bourget and Chalmers to obtain the raw survey information in an effort to create an interactive web application. In May 2023, the task of developing the app was assigned to undergraduate Jacob Shankles, who programmed the app with advisory help from Josh Brekel and Dr. Aaron Nielson, which was then continued through the following semester.
  The app file is app.R, while the setup related to it can be found in newapp.rmd. The other app stuff file is graphs and data manipulations incase they are needed again. The Research file is the original design of the app that was meant to be used with multiple links which is not allowed on shinyapps.io.
